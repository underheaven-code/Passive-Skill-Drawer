The 1.0 Passive Skill lottery made by a friend.

To draw a skill just execute the .exe file and a screen should pop up for you to draw a skill. Its a shortcut so if you wanna move the app out of the file it won't affect its functionallity as long as you don't delete the file.

If you want to add/remove or edit skills, go into the lottery file open the skills.text file, with any text editor, in there all skills are listed in the format of: (NUMBER). (NAME OF THE PASSIVE) - (EFFECT). simply add a new skill at the end following the counting and careful to not use a '-' in the description of your skill or it may break the code
